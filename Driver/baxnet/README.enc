ENC624J6Net - A SANA-II driver for the Scratze card

ENC624J6Net Copyright (C) 2018 Henryk Richter <henryk.richter@gmx.net>

This driver is supposed to support ENC624J600 based ethernet
on the ZII LAN IDE CP card designed by Matze (a1k.org) and Scrat (a1k.org).

Please see at the end of the file for information about licensing 
conditions.


Installation:
-------------

Installation of the driver is straightforward. 
Just copy the enc624j6net.device to devs:networks and enable 
the interface in your favorite  TCP/IP stack as usual. There is a version
for MC68020 or later (enc624j6net.device) and another version for 
68000 (enc624j6net.device_68000). Choose the right one.

So far, successful tests have been done with the free AmiTCP/IP 3.0b2, 
AmiTCP4.0-4.2, Genesis, MiamiDX and RoadShow. 

The Zorro board itself should be visible in early startup with manufacturer 
ID 2588 and card ID 123. 



Configuration options
---------------------

No special configuration of the driver is necessary for normal operation. 
The configuration options outlined below are documented for tuning purposes.

The config to be placed in ENVARC:sana2/enc624j6net.config and consists
of a single line with parameters (much like CLI parameters).

PRIORITY=PRI/K/N,BPS/K/N,MTU/K/N,FULLDUPLEX/S,FLOWCONTROL/S,TIMER/K/N,MULTICAST/S

 FULLDUPLEX     - change Ethernet module into full duplex mode, 
                  caution: requires manual configuration of duplex mode
                           on the switch, too.
                  note: this switch should not be enabled in normal cases.
                        The module feeatures autoconfiguration that determines
                        speed and duplex automatically.

 PRIORITY       - server task priority (default 1)

 BPS            - bit per seconds for statistics purposes

 MTU            - maximum transmission unit (default 1500) 

 MULTICAST      - obsolete, kept for config file backwards compatibility with 
                  old driver

 FLOWCONTROL    - enable automatic flow control that throttles incoming
                  data when the hardware buffer gets full

 example (useful for DSL via PPPoE with AmiTCP):
  echo "MTU=1492 PRIORITY=6" >ENVARC:sana2/enc624j6net.config  


Changelog:
----------

1.91  - first Beta of completely rewritten driver
      - support for concurrent IP stacks
      - faster handling of statistics
      - multiple board support where applicable
      - workaround for Shapeshifter network plugin bug
      - GCC or VBCC as compiler (cross or native compilation)
      - faster lowlevel read/write


Compilation / Development Notes
-------------------------------

Either VBCC or GCC (tested with version 2.95 only) can be used. General
options for compiler usage can be found in Common.mk. Also, you might want
to adapt the paths to your setup (PREFX,SYSINC). In addition to the regular
NDK, the sana2.h is expected in the devices/ subdir of the includes. sana2.h
may be found in the AmiTCP or Roadshow SDK, respectively.

Call

 make -f Makefile.enc

for building the device. 

VBCC note: When calling the GNU Make port supplied with ADE/GG natively on AmigaOS3, 
please make sure that "vc" is within the search path of "/bin/sh".

Conceptually, the driver was meant to support multiple hardware targets. Therefore,
it features a SANA-II frontend (device.c,deviceheader.c,deviceinit.c), a main
server running in a task (server.c) and several hardware backends. A new hardware
backend requires customized implementation of hw.c and hwprivate.h, along with
additional hardware-specfic code, if needed. The device unit structure reserves
three LONGS and three pointers for exclusive use by the hardware instance. Additional
data for the hardware can be auto-allocated at device initialization time, if necessary.
See "struct HWData" in hwprivate.h of existing backends.
