These are the AmigaOS drivers for the subsystems of the board.

The recommended SANA-II driver for the Ethernet port is located in "baxnet". 

Please use enc624j6net.device from baxnet/bin on MC68020 or faster CPUs. A cut-down version for 68000 and 68010 is provided as well. Please rename enc624j6net.device_68000 to enc624j6net.device before copying it to DEVS:Networks.
