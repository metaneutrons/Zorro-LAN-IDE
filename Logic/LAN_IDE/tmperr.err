INFO:Cpld - Inferring BUFG constraint for signal 'CLK_EXT' based upon the LOC
   constraint 'P30'. It is recommended that you declare this BUFG explicitedly
   in your design. Note that for certain device families the output of a BUFG
   constraint can not drive a gated clock, and the BUFG constraint will be
   ignored.

WARNING:Cpld:896 - Unable to map all desired signals into function block, FB5,
   because too many function block product terms are required. Buffering output
   signal CP_CS to allow all signals assigned to this function block to be
   placed.
ERROR:Cpld:886 - Function block FB1 was too congested to route successfully.
   This occurs due to excessive (>= 50) product term input fanins to this
   function block. Consider moving output signals in this function block to less
   congested function blocks, buffering output signals that must remain in this
   function block, or selecting a larger package.
ERROR:Cpld:868 - Cannot fit the design into any of the specified devices with
   the selected implementation options.
