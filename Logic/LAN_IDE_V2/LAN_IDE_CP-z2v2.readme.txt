Important: The Zorro-II firmware dated 15-Jul-2020 and later
changes the handling of the "IDE_OFF" jumper compared to earlier
firmwares. Now IDE_OFF now behaves as stated on the silkscreen
and will disable the IDE controller if the jumper is set.

This changed behaviour is consistent with the Zorro-III firmware
now.
